# Emmanuel Hilary

**Engineer at the edge of AI 🤖, backend systems 🛠️, and cloud infrastructure ☁️.**

I build machines that think, systems that scale, and tools that adapt. My work sits at the intersection of intelligent automation and reliable engineering backend APIs infused with AI, deployed in the cloud, and grounded in data.

## Core Focus

* **AI Engineering** – LLMs, RAG pipelines 📚, autonomous agents 🧭, smart APIs
* **Backend Architecture** – Distributed systems, event-driven design, microservices
* **Cloud & Infra** – AWS, containers 🐳, CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure as code
* **Data** – Structured/unstructured data pipelines, embeddings, real-time processing ⚡

## Ethos

* Build systems that teach themselves 🧠
* Code for clarity, not cleverness
* Automate boring things 🔁
* Architect for failure and scale 🔐
