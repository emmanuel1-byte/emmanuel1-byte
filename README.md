## Engineer at the intersection of AI, backend systems, and cloud infrastructure.

I build machines that think, systems that scale, and tools that adapt. My work lives where code meets intelligence backend services powered by data, deployed in the cloud, and enhanced by AI.

## Core Focus

* **AI Engineering** – Language models, intelligent APIs, context-aware systems
* **Backend Architecture** – Distributed systems, API design, event-driven apps
* **Cloud & Infra** – AWS, containers, CI/CD, infrastructure as code
* **Data** – Modeling, storage, pipelines, real-time flow

## Ethos

* Simplicity wins
* Data tells the truth
* Automate what repeats
* Design like the next dev is sleep-deprived
